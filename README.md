# Akasha v0.3.0

Akasha is now a **reinforcing memory organism**.

It remembers.
It prefers.
It becomes.

---

## New in v0.3.0

- Associative reinforcement between memories
- Identity bias based on recall history
- Nomadic crypto simulation (scatter / gather)
- Executable demo narrative

---

## Quickstart

```bash
python akasha.py add "Akasha awakens"
python akasha.py recall Akasha
```

---

## Demonstration

```bash
python demo/demo.py
```

Observe how repeated recall changes Akasha's behavior.

---

## Philosophy

Memory is not neutral.
What is recalled becomes *who we are*.
