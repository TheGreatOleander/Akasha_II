# Akasha v0.4.1

Akasha is a canonical memory and execution boundary.
It separates meaning from action and preserves human intent
across time, tools, and models.

This release (0.4.1) tightens **boundary integrity** and
explicitly addresses agency drift, semantic granularity,
and translation safety.
